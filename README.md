# PythonVideoPlayer

This was a project which was assigned during computer science.
The task was to program an Video Player which displays two videos at once.

## What I have learned

I have learned to build a python application to display two different videos at once.
Additionally there are some simple controls to stop the video, go back and skip 90 frames.
